# jQuery the anti-pattern framework. 
## Approaching the front end like an engineer.

I’m not dogging on jQuery, at all, in fact. But most people who are just getting into building client side apps come from a jQuery background and try to use that experience when they’re asked to build increasingly complex client-side applications.

Meanwhile, many self-described "real" developers still think browser code is sissy stuff. Because in their mind, the client is easy and it’s what the designer-y folks do.

But really, they’re scared of the browser and the DOM. The old approach of hitting a database, rendering some html on the server side and then adding a few jQuery fades and transitions on the client-side is *not* what we’re talking about here. 

We’re talking about *engineering* a UI.

The problem is, many of the people who are being asked to build these apps don’t have a heavy engineering background and approach the task much like they would any other client code. 

Say it with me now: apps are not websites.
