# This isn’t a javascript book

Yup, if that’s what you were expecting. Request a refund now. This isn’t about language syntax, it’s not about the 4 ways to execute a function, it’s not about introducing you to twelve available client frameworks. This is about how *we* build apps at &yet. 

It’s descriptive, not prescriptive. How you build is up to you. The hope is that we can introduce enough concepts, tools and philosophy to brainwash you to blindly follow our way of thinking :)
